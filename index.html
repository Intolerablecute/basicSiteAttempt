    <h2>A little about us</h2>
    <p>
      We’re one of Scotland’s largest triathlon clubs with over 200 members of all abilities, from the complete novice
      to experienced age group world champions. Members participate in all distances from sprint, standard, half and
      full ironman as well as aquathlons, adventure races and off road MTB endurance events.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand that it can be a daunting experience turning up to a training session and trying to find out
      everything from scratch, particularly if you are a ‘beginner’ in one or more of the swim/bike/run activities.
      We’ve all been a newcomer at some point so at Edinburgh triathletes you’ll find that we’re a friendly bunch with
      common interests in triathlon, swimming, cycling or running. So, you’ll be warmly welcomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our sessions cater for beginners, so the best thing to do is just come along and try a few sessions out! Just
      use the Contact for so we can arrange a suitable session and come along a few minutes earlier to introduce
      yourself to the coach. You’ll be advised where to go and what to do, depending on your level.

    <h2>Club training</h2>
    <p>
      Most of our sessions are free to members but there are various additional activities for those who are keen. These
      include coached running sessions on an athletics track, indoor spin sessions during the winter months and
      occasional weekend training trips which are a great chance to get to know other club members.

      All club training sessions are booked and coordinated using the Spond app. This is convenient way to manage group
      numbers and ensure everyone is up to date. If you are thinking of joining the club and would like to come and try
      a session just get in touch using the Contact Us form and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.

      If you’re interested in joining the club, all the details can be found on the membership page. We’re currently
      operating a waiting list for swim memberships due to ongoing limits upon capacity since Covid but please do get in
      touch if you’d like to be added and in the meantime you’re very welcome to join as a bike and run member!

      For an indication of the training schedule please take a look at the Calendar page.

    <h2>Club history</h2>
    <p>
      The inspiration for Edinburgh Triathletes came in the early 1980s after Andrew Grant saw the Hawaii 'Ironman'
      triathlon on television. Andrew explains how it all began:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘After watching the 1983 triathlon in Hawaii, I thought I would like to have a bash at that. I had been active in
      marathon running and have always been a keen cyclist; swam like a stone though. I tried to find a competition but
      none existed. Being the kind of guy I was, I decided to organise an event – I didn’t know how, but was keen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time, I taught at Wester Hailes Education Centre and we had a pool. The head teacher was keen to promote
      anything that served to increase the profile of the centre and we had a great team of poolside attendants. I
      scouted around and eventually got info on how to organise an event from the Irish Triathlon Association. However,
      I did not fully realise what I had to do – there were no organising committees in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eight months’ preparation went into the event: I had to contact police, first aid, communications people,
      the education committee, roads departments and so on. I even had to draw the competitors’ numbers myself. Getting
      assistance – timekeepers, marshals and admin on the day became horrendous. Eventually, I cajoled three friendly
      staff, all my family and numerous friends to do the job and got assistance from the soldiers at Redford barracks
      in exchange for two free places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event took place in May 1984 and was a complete success. I continued to organise the event for four years, and
      was gradually able to get others to assist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triathlons were suddenly the thing for active sports people to do and clubs sprang up everywhere in Scotland but
      the Edinburgh group remained informal. We managed to get use of the pool at Fettes school and we started to
      ‘train’ there after a bike bash on Saturday mornings. It was mooted many times that we form a club and this was
      formalised in 1990.”
