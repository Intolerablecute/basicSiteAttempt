        <h1>Choosing the right swim session</h1>
        <p>
            Swim sessions cater for all levels and abilities and are based on Swim Smooth principles, as recommended by
            British Triathlon. Sessions are led by our qualified coaches, so whether you’re an experienced triathlete or
            new to the sport you’ll be catered for.

            Check out the training calendar for a session that’s fits with your schedule and come along. If its your
            first time then arrive at pool side a few minutes early and introduce yourself to one of our friendly
            coaches. They will make sure you start off in the right lane for your ability.

            Remember if you’re new to the club you can try out a few sessions before you decide to join. Contact us if
            you have any questions about our swim session.
        </p>

        <h2>Open water swimming</h2>
        <p>
            During the Summer months many of our members organise open water swims. Typically these are led rather than
            coached and are usually organised via the club’s Facebook page.

            Before taking part in open water swimming take logical steps to risk assess the situation and don’t do it if
            you are in doubt. Please also make yourself familiar with the Scottish Outdoor Access Code which in relation
            to open water swimming states:

            Access rights extend to swimming (subject to any local byelaws). Remember that swimming in open water can be
            dangerous, particularly for children, and that the water might be used for public water supply. Help to
            minimise problems for other users by:

            not swimming close to water intakes, abstraction points or spillways
            avoiding nets or other fishing tackle
            not disturbing anglers and other water users
            not polluting the water, and
            being aware that in prolonged dry spells fish might be distressed due to low water levels.
            Open-water swimming can be a shock to the system at first, but once you acclimatise you’ll find it
            thrilling. The psychological and physiological impact is completely different to indoor pool-based swimming
            so it’s important to get your body acclimatised to the temperature. You should always be accompanied by
            another when swimming in open water preferably someone with open water experience. Here in Scotland, and
            depending on the time of year, you will almost certainly need a wetsuit too. Make sure you bring along
            plenty of warm clothing to change into afterwards!
        </p>

        <h2>Swim etiquette</h2>
        <p>
            Don’t let a crowded pool of speedy swimmers intimate you. As a club member you are expected to show respect
            and understanding for the safety of others.

            Our guide below ensures that all members regardless of ability get the most out of our swim sessions:

            Be prepared: Be on time for training sessions, wearing suitable kit for training.
            Judging your pace: If it’s your first swim session, arrive a few minutes early at poolside and introduce
            yourself to the coach who will discuss which lane you’ll be most suited for.
            Getting in: Dangling your legs in from the side to let swimmers know you’re there is useful if you’re
            disrupting the rhythm of a lane and it’s ok to jump or dive in if the area around you is clear, but you
            should never dive if the depth is less than 1.8 metres.
            Listen: Try to follow our coaches’ instructions and if you don’t understand please ask for clarification.
            Foot tapping: It’s the universal gesture among club swimmers – if you want to overtake, tap the toes of the
            swimmer in front and they should pause at the end of the lane to let you pass.
            Resting at the end of a lane: Stay tucked into the corner if resting between sets so other swimmers have
            room to turn and push off.
            Tumble turns: Only use this manoeuvre if you are confident there is no one behind you because you might
            collide as they reach the end of the lane while you’re still flipping over. If the coast is clear, make sure
            you exit the wall on the other side of the lane. The same applies to pushing off.
            In general race tattoos should not be left on the skin for an extended period. However, some tattoos are
            stubborn to remove and if they are still present during swim sessions then the area should be washed and the
            tattoo should not be flaking (i.e. so no bits are left in the water).
        </p>

        <h2>
            Club wetsuit hire
        </h2>
        <p>
            Any member can hire one of the club’s wetsuits. There are several sizes on offer.

            To book a wetsuit or make an enquiry, please email wetsuit@edinburghtri.org detailing the loan period
            required (start and end dates, allowing 2 days either side for hand overs) and size (depending on weight and
            height).
        </p>

        <h2>
            Swim kit
        </h2>

        <p>
            Outlined below is a suggested kit-list which our coaches have put together and encourage athletes to bring
            along to pool sessions. This will allow the coaches to incorporate relevant drills and practices to aid your
            swim training. They are not mandatory but will make certain drills and practices easier to complete.

            If you’ve any questions, please ask one of our coaches. We have an ‘Affiliation’ with Swimshop who offer a
            10% discount on equipment and have put a bundle package together for Edinburgh Triathlete members which will
            give you everything you need.

            Pull Buoy: A generic adult sized foam swim buoy will be fine.
            Hand Paddles: We recommend the Finis Freestylers, technique training paddles, rather than strength training
            paddles, which help with stroke/catch development.
            Kick Board: A generic adult sized foam kick board will be fine.
            Fins: Typical rubber fins with a heel cup as pictured will be fine and will allow a wider repertoire of kick
            drills to be incorporated into sessions. For those who suffer from achilleas pain, fins such as the
            AquaSphere Alpha (the blue ones in the picture) allow greater ankle flex and may be easier to use. Those who
            suffer badly from cramp may even want to look for longer length diving-type fins which also reduces load on
            the calf.
