  <h2>Join our club</h2>

    We have three categories of membership to cover all training appetites. Bronze members can join in with all club
    activities except for indoor swimming sessions. Silver members can attend one indoor swim session a week and Gold
    members are entitled to attend as many swim sessions as they like.

    The reason for this is quite simply that pool bookings are the main cost for the club.
